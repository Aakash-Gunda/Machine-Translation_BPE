# Machine-Translation_BPE
In this notebook, we aim build a deep neural network that tries to enhance the language translation process by introducing a sub-word tokenization algorithm called byte pair encoding. Final pipeline will accept English text as input and return the French translation.

# Setup
This project requires GPU acceleration to run efficiently. You can use GPU from either your personal system's GPU or GPU provided by Google Colab.
