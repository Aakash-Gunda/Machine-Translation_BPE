# Machine-Translation_BPE
In this notebook, we aim build a deep neural network that tries to enhance the language translation process by introducing a sub-word tokenization algorithm called byte pair encoding. Final pipeline will accept English text as input and return the French translation.

# Setup
This project requires GPU acceleration to run efficiently. You can use GPU from either your personal system's GPU or GPU provided by Google Colab.

# Technologies used:
   #### TensorFlow: 
   TensorFlow is an end-to-end open-source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML powered applications.

  #### Collaboratory: 
  Free Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup and runs entirely in the cloud. It Provides GPU which is required for this project.

  #### Keras: 
  Keras is a deep learning API written in Python, running on top of the machine learning platform TensorFlow. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation.
